# geomagnetic_thermal_mantle

## Project Description

This project aims to leverage satellite magnetic datasets, such as those from missions like **MAGSAT**, **MSS-1**, and **Swarm**, along with geomagnetic data collected from ground observatory stations, to investigate and map the electrical conductivity structure of the Earth's mantle. By integrating these geomagnetic observations with advanced thermodynamic equilibrium models, we seek to understand the mineral compositions, phase fractions, and associated properties of mantle materials at various depths.

Using a combination of geomagnetic data inversion, thermodynamic modeling, and laboratory-based experiments, the project will estimate critical mantle properties, including temperature distribution, mineral composition, and water content. Such information is crucial for understanding the dynamic processes within the Earth's interior, which drive phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, mantle convection, and plate tectonics.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Conductivity Structure Analysis**: Utilize satellite and ground-based geomagnetic datasets to infer the electrical conductivity structure of the Earth's mantle.
2. **Thermodynamic Modeling**: Apply thermodynamic equilibrium theory to predict mantle mineral phase fractions and compositions based on conductivity profiles.
3. **Laboratory Calibration**: Use lab-based experiments to calibrate and validate thermodynamic models, providing insights into mantle properties such as temperature and water content.
4. **Integration of Multi-Source Data**: Combine satellite, ground-based, and laboratory data to build a comprehensive model of the mantle's physical and chemical properties.
5. **Application to Geodynamics**: Provide key insights into mantle dynamics, aiding in the understanding of volcanic activities, deep water cycling, and the mechanisms driving plate tectonics.

### Project Impact:
By developing an integrated framework to analyze geomagnetic and thermodynamic data, this project will deliver an unprecedented understanding of the Earthâ€™s mantle. The results will contribute significantly to geosciences, offering enhanced predictions of volcanic eruptions, insights into the global water cycle, and a deeper understanding of the forces driving tectonic plates. These findings will be invaluable for researchers studying Earth dynamics and could have far-reaching implications for natural hazard mitigation and resource exploration.

This project will result in open-source tools and data products made available through GitHub, fostering collaboration and innovation within the geoscience community.
